# CONCEPT

The idea is to create an app that creates the user diary by speech. The app will allow the user to enter some voice audio, and the app will tranform the speech into text and display it in the screen. This might solve the sometimes tedious task of keeping your diary up to date by writing it manually.

# GOALS

Since this is a big project, the first task would be to set up an actual Speech-to-Text functionality that displays what the user says on the screen as text.

Following tasks would be to allow the user multiple audios, and to allow modifying the direct translation.

The final tasks would be to set up a user login/password and a database where to store the user's data, and finally set up a user page where all the diaries are shown.
